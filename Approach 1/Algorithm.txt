Physics:

      -> Angular displacement (theta):
      
         theta = theta sub naught + omega sub naught * time + (1/2) * alpha * time^2
      
      -> Angulare velocity (omega):
     
         omega = omega sub naught + alpha * time
         --or--
         omega^2 = omega sub naught ^2 + 2 * alpha *(theta - theta sub naught)
      
      -> Angular acceleration (alpha):
      
         alpha average = change in omega / change in time
      
      -> Kinetic energy of a rotating object:
          K = (1/2)*I*omega^2 where I is moment of inertia
          
      -> 
      

Are we going to assume that there is no skidding?? Sure

Non-slip conditions: 

Build in the condition that speed equal to zero means the ball stops

Do we want to find out when friction takes out all energy from the ball?
